                I am a junior at Indiana University currently studying computing fundamentals. 
            I am working as an intern at Serve IT to increase accessibility. 
            Last year I was a teacher at Teach IT and I taught elementary school students about STEM concepts. 
            My goal is to share the wonders of technology in an accessible way. 
            Currently I am working on creating and managing websites for the Bloomington Orchard. 
            I am very excited to help the community with my skills by improving website accessibility. 
            I have also worked as an IU teaching assistant for two semesters for an introductory computer science course.
