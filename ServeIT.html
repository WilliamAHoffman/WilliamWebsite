    <div class = "identifier" style = "text-align: left;"> Problem Statement</div>
    <div class = "mainParagraph" style = "padding-top: 0.5em;"> Teach-IT hosts a weekly club for students at the Crestmont Boys and Girls club. This club focuses on teaching students about technology and other STEM topics.</div>
    <div class = "identifier" style = "text-align: left;"> Team Mission</div>
    <div class = "mainParagraph" style = "padding-top: 0.5em;"> Teach-IT gives presentations every week about topics such as: 
        probability, scratch coding and computer art. These presentations have been created by past and current IU students. 
        As a Teach-IT intern I worked to inspire students and engage them in learning by teaching hands on STEM activities. 
        These activities included educational games, Scratch coding and fun quizzes.</div>
    <div class = "identifier" style = "text-align: left;"> The Work</div>
    <div class = "mainParagraph" style = "padding-top: 0.5em;"> Our team worked with Crestmont Boys and Girls club in Bloomington. 
        We used Microsoft Teams to plan and develop in depth activities for the club each week. We met once a week for an hour and gave presentations on topics in STEM. 
        These topics included probability, coding and online safety.</div>
    <div class = "mainParagraph" style = "padding-top: 0.5em;"> We came up with new lesson plans for future Teach IT teams to use. 
        We worked with industry mentors to learn more about the field. 
        We kept track of our hours on spread sheets and made sure we worked efficiently with our time. </div>
    <div class = "identifier" style = "text-align: left;"> Reflection</div>
    <div class = "mainParagraph" style = "padding-top: 0.5em;"> Our team did a good job at keeping students engaged and excited to participate in class.
        We taught the students more about the digital world and even learned some new things ourselves. It taught us more about using websites and platforms to work with a larger team. 
        My favorite part of working at Teach IT was seeing the students who chose to come back every week. I was proud to know Teach IT was making a difference in their week. 
        The experience has shown me the value of serving the community first hand.</div>

        <div class = "identifier" style = "text-align: left;"> Mission Statement</div>
        <div class = "mainParagraph" style = "padding-top: 0.5em;"> "To improve access to healthy, locally grown, and sustainable food in Monroe County by assessing the food system, educating the community on food issues, and advocating for policies that help support a stronger and healthier food system."</div>
        <div class = "identifier" style = "text-align: left;"> Problem Statement</div>
        <div class = "mainParagraph" style = "padding-top: 0.5em;"> The accessibility team works to provide consistency and access to those who need it most.</div>
        <div class = "identifier" style = "text-align: left;"> Team Mission</div>
        <div class = "mainParagraph" style = "padding-top: 0.5em;"> I was a memeber of the accessibility team working on behalf of the Serve IT Clinic to check sites for usability and accessibility, ensuring that each site is the best we can make it. This work involves conducting various tests and assessments to help build sites.</div>
        <div class = "identifier" style = "text-align: left;"> The Work</div>
        <div class = "mainParagraph" style = "padding-top: 0.5em;"> At Serve IT I worked with a team of several other hard working members of the community. We used several different tools such as Kanban, Trello and Microsoft Teams to communicate and work on several tasks at once. The work was meaningful and required a lot of care and attention.</div>
        <div class = "mainParagraph" style = "padding-top: 0.5em;"> This work included using Axe Devtools and Google Web Developer to manage websites and check for accessibility requirements. We followed the WCAG AA standard guidelines to ensure a consistent and positive experience for all of our clientâ€™s website users. The Bloomington Orchard was thankful for receiving our help.</div>
        <div class = "identifier" style = "text-align: left;"> Reflection</div>
        <div class = "mainParagraph" style = "padding-top: 0.5em;"> Our team worked closely with our clients and other development teams to create the best sites possible. 
            I have been very grateful to be a part of a larger community which is striving to make a difference. 
            This was a fun experience and it allowed me to be more involved with the process of creation and testing of websites. 
            I was also provided some creative freedom to created posts for the team's social media accounts. I also enjoyed working with an industry mentor to help me to better understand my field.
