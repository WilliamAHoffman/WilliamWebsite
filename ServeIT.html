    <div class = "mainParagraph" style = "padding-top: 0.5em;"> Teach-IT hosts a weekly club for students at the Crestmont Boys and Girls club. This club focuses on teaching students about technology and other STEM topics.</div>
    <div class = "identifier" style = "text-align: left;"> Team Mission</div>
    <div class = "mainParagraph" style = "padding-top: 0.5em;"> Teach-IT gives presentations every week about topics such as: 
        propability, scratch coding and computer art. These presentations have been created by past and current students. 
        As Teach-IT interns we look to inspire students and engage them in learn by having hands on activities. These activities include games, scratch and fun quizzes.</div>
    <div class = "identifier" style = "text-align: left;"> The Work</div>
    <div class = "mainParagraph" style = "padding-top: 0.5em;"> Our team worked with Crestmont Boys and Girls club in Bloomington. 
        We used Microsoft Teams to plan and develope in depth activities for the club each week. We met once a week for an hour and gave a presentation on a topic in STEM. 
        These topics included: probability, coding and online safety.</div>
    <div class = "mainParagraph" style = "padding-top: 0.5em;"> We came up with new lesson plans for future Teach IT teams to use. 
        We worked with industry mentors to learn more about the feild. 
        We kept track of our hours on spread sheets and made sure we worked efficiently with our time. </div>
    <div class = "identifier" style = "text-align: left;"> Reflection</div>
    <div class = "mainParagraph" style = "padding-top: 0.5em;"> Our team has done a good job at keeping students engaged. Every week we saw new students excited to participate.
        We taught the students more about the digital world and even learned some new things for ourselves. It taught me more about using websites and platforms to work with a larger team. 
        My favorite part of working at Teach IT was seeing the students who chose to come back every week. I knew Teach IT was making a difference in their week. 
        The experience has shown me the value of serving the community first hand.</div>

        <div class = "mainParagraph" style = "padding-top: 0.5em;"> At Serve IT I have worked with a team of several other hard working members of the community. We used several different tools such as Kanban, Trello and Microsoft Teams to communicate and work on several tasks at once. The work was meaningful and required lots of care and attention.</div>
        <div class = "mainParagraph" style = "padding-top: 0.5em;"> This work included using Axe Devtools and Google Web Developer to manage websites and check for accessibility requirements.

        <div class = "mainParagraph" style = "padding-top: 0.5em;"> Our team worked closely with our clients and other development teams to create the best sites possible. 
            I have been very grateful to be a part of a larger community which can make a difference. 
            Taking on two credits was a fun experience and it allowed me to be more involved with the process of creation and testing. 
            I was also provided some creative freedom when I created posts for the team's social media accounts. I also enjoyed working with an industry mentor to better understand my field.
