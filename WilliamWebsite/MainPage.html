                I am in my fifth semester at Indiana University and am currently studying computing fundementals. 
            I am working with Teach IT to inspire the next generation. 
            Last semester I focused on giving STEM related presentations to the youth in Bloomington! 
            My goal was to share the wonders of technology in an accessible way. 
            This semester I will be working on creating and managing websites for non-profits. I am very excited to help the community with my skills.
